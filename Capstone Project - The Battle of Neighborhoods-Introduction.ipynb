    "According to Bloomberg News, the London Housing Market is in a rut. It is now facing a number of different headwinds, including the prospect of higher taxes and a warning from the Bank of England that U.K. home values could fall as much as 30 percent in the event of a disorderly exit from the European Union. More specifically, four overlooked cracks suggest that the London market may be in worse shape than many realize: hidden price falls, record-low sales, homebuilder exodus and tax hikes addressing overseas buyers of homes in England and Wales.\n",

As a result, the business problem we are currently posing is: how could we provide support to homebuyers clientele in to purchase a suitable real estate in London in this uncertain economic and financial scenario?\n",

    "To solve this business problem, we are going to cluster London neighborhoods in order to recommend venues and the current average price of real estate where homebuyers can make a real estate investment. We will recommend profitable venues according to amenities and essential facilities surrounding such venues i.e. elementary schools, high schools, hospitals & grocery stores."

Accordingly, one might target under-priced real estates in these areas of London in order to make a business affair.\n",

    "Second, we may analyze our results according to the five clusters we have produced. Even though, all clusters could praise an optimal range of facilities and amenities, we have found two main patterns. The first pattern we are referring to, i.e. Clusters 0, 2 and 4, may target home buyers prone to live in 'green' areas with parks, waterfronts. Instead, the second pattern we are referring to, i.e. Clusters 1 and 3, may target individuals who love pubs, theatres and soccer."

    "Second, The Methodology section comprised four stages: 1. Collect Inspection Data; 2. Explore and Understand Data; 3. Data preparation and preprocessing; 4. Modeling. In particular, in the modeling section, we used the k-means clustering technique as it is fast and efficient in terms of computational cost, is highly flexible to account for mutations in real estate market in London and is accurate.\n",

    "Finally, we drew the conclusion that even though the London Housing Market may be in a rut, it is still an \"ever-green\" for business affairs.
